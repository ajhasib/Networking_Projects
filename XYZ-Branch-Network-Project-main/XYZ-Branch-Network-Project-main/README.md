# XYZ Company Branch Network Design

Project Overview Designed and simulated a multi-VLAN network architecture for a new branch office using Cisco Packet Tracer. The project required segmenting traffic for three distinct departments (Admin, Finance, Reception) using a single physical router and switch.

Key Technologies

VLANs (802.1Q): Segmented broadcast domains for security.

Router-on-a-Stick: Configured sub-interfaces for Inter-VLAN routing.

DHCP: Implemented dynamic IP allocation for 100+ hosts.

Subnetting: Optimized a /24 network block into efficient /26 subnets.

Topology

Verification

Traffic Isolation: Verified VLAN assignments using show vlan brief.

Routing: Confirmed routing table population for all 3 subnets.
